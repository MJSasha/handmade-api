- [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.postgresql/postgresql)
- [Project Lombok](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok)

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement methods:
    - [ ] Get all models
    - [x] Get model by id
    - [x] Add model
    - [ ] Model editing
    - [ ] Delete model
- [ ] Deploy the project to the server

## What I'm struggling with

The findAll() method throws an error. Googled for a few days, then gave up and posted a 
[question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71442906/crudrepository-findall).
